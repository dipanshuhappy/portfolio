# Normie.tech Stablecoin Infrastructure

At Normie.tech, I led the development and scaling of our stablecoin infrastructure, building a robust system capable of handling millions of dollars in transaction volume while maintaining security and reliability.

## Project Overview

The stablecoin infrastructure project involved creating a comprehensive system for minting, burning, and managing stablecoin tokens with automated collateral management and real-time price feeds.

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contract Layer
- **ERC-20 Compliant Stablecoin**: Built with OpenZeppelin standards
- **Collateral Management**: Automated over-collateralization system
- **Price Oracle Integration**: Chainlink price feeds for real-time data
- **Emergency Mechanisms**: Circuit breakers and pause functionality

### Backend Services
```solidity
// Example: Core stablecoin contract structure
contract NormieStablecoin is ERC20, Ownable, ReentrancyGuard {
    using SafeMath for uint256;

    mapping(address => uint256) public collateralBalances;
    uint256 public constant COLLATERAL_RATIO = 150; // 150%

    function mint(uint256 amount) external nonReentrant {
        uint256 requiredCollateral = calculateCollateral(amount);
        require(collateralBalances[msg.sender] >= requiredCollateral, "Insufficient collateral");

        _mint(msg.sender, amount);
        emit Mint(msg.sender, amount);
    }
}
```

## Key Features

### 1. Automated Collateral Management
- Real-time monitoring of collateralization ratios
- Automatic liquidation mechanisms
- Multi-asset collateral support

### 2. Scalable Backend
- Microservices architecture with Docker containers
- Redis caching for high-frequency operations
- PostgreSQL for persistent data storage
- Event-driven architecture with message queues

### 3. Security Measures
- Multi-signature wallet integration
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Comprehensive audit trails
- Automated security monitoring

## Performance Metrics

- **Transaction Throughput**: 1000+ TPS during peak periods
- **Uptime**: 99.9% availability maintained
- **Volume Processed**: $50M+ in total transaction volume
- **Gas Optimization**: 40% reduction in transaction costs

## Challenges Solved

### Scalability Issues
Initially, the system struggled with high transaction volumes. I implemented:
- Database query optimization
- Caching layers with Redis
- Load balancing across multiple nodes

### Security Vulnerabilities
Identified and resolved several security issues:
- Reentrancy attacks prevention
- Flash loan attack mitigation
- Access control improvements

## Technology Stack

- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity, Hardhat, OpenZeppelin
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Redis caching
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS
- **Monitoring**: Grafana, Prometheus, DataDog

## Impact

The infrastructure improvements resulted in:
- 300% increase in transaction processing capacity
- 50% reduction in operational costs
- Zero security incidents during my tenure
- Successful handling of multiple high-volume events

## Lessons Learned

1. **Security is Paramount**: Every line of smart contract code must be thoroughly audited
2. **Monitoring is Critical**: Real-time monitoring saved us from several potential issues
3. **Scalability Planning**: Always design for 10x current load
4. **Community Feedback**: User feedback was invaluable for feature prioritization

This project was instrumental in establishing Normie.tech as a reliable player in the DeFi space and taught me valuable lessons about building production-ready blockchain infrastructure.
