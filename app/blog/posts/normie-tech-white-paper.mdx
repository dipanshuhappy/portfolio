# The Credit Card Checkout That Pays You in Stablecoins

### The Normie Tech White Paper

## Executive Summary

Learning to send crypto is difficult. So, we built a credit card checkout page that pays you in stablecoins. Your customers pay the way they are used to while you receive pay how you want to.

**Customer sees:** Simple credit card checkout
**Receiver sees:** Stablecoins in their wallet

## The Problem

Web3 has a usability problem.

In order to onboard someone to send you crypto or use a blockchain platform, they need to learn:

- What exchange to use
- How to KYC
- What network to send on
- Gas fees
- Non-custodial vs custodial wallets
- Secret keys

After they figured that out and try to buy crypto, then **3/4 of attempts to onramp are declined.**

We cannot build democratized, easily accessible systems when most people can't figure out how to get started.

## The Solution

Customers simply check out with a credit or debit card.

They don't need to KYC. They don't even need to know that they are using crypto.

### How is this possible?

Because, unlike with exchanges or onramps, customers are simply sending payments. They don't receive any crypto in exchange.

We take the funds in fiat, we purchase crypto from an exchange, and then we forward those payments to the destination as stablecoins.

**Example:**
Customer sends USD → Normie.tech turns USD into USDC → Business wallet or smart contract receives USDC

The whole process takes 4 seconds.

We accomplish this by holding stablecoin liquidity to settle the payments within seconds and then replenish our liquidity.

### Who Is This For?

**1. Web3 platforms that want to allow their smart contracts to accept credit card payments**
- 1000x your potential users (thousands of people on a particular blockchain vs billions of CC holders)
- 100x easier to onboard non crypto users

**2. Wallets that want a "Payment Link" feature**
- Users can send a URL to anyone to pay them
- Person paying doesn't need to create an account and can easily check out
- Payment arrives in the wallet within seconds

**3. Businesses in high inflation countries who want to receive pay in stablecoins**
- Receive pay in seconds rather than days
- Avoid higher inflation currencies
- Avoid unreliable banking systems
- Allow customers unfamiliar with crypto to pay with ease
- Customers don't need to create an account
- Embed a checkout page in a website or simply send a payment link

## Massive Potential

2.3T in stablecoin payments occurred in 2023 and this is growing by 17% year over year (Coinbase Market Intelligence). While most people do not yet understand how to send stablecoins, an increasing number of businesses wish to receive payments as stablecoins. We make this easy.

## Our History

Our team built a blockchain platform for crowdfunding prizes.

We had the goal to make it "so easy that my mom could use it."

Turns out, making it easy for non crypto users was the hardest part.

Through months of effort we built a seamless system that generated a wallet for each user with email login and assigned gasless on-chain voting rights based on credit card payments.

Other web3 platforms contacted us asking to build the same system for them, and we realized that solving onboarding is the greatest challenge for web3.

## Conclusion

Don't limit your customers to only crypto bros. Work with Normie Tech and let your mom use web3.

The future of web3 adoption isn't about teaching everyone to become crypto experts - it's about making the technology invisible to the end user while delivering the benefits they care about: fast, cheap, secure payments that work globally. Normie Tech bridges the gap between the financial system people know and the financial future we're building.
