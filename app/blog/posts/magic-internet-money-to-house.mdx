# We turned Magic Internet Money into a house!

4 months ago we did an integration that allowed people to donate on-chain using PayPal to projects supporting youth in need. It's amazing to see that within a few months these crypto transfers have turned into real world impact by providing essential housing.

## Real Impact in Vietnam

Already a project that received those funds used them to build a house in Vietnam to house a family and their kids after their prior home was destroyed in a typhoon.

This is exactly the kind of transformative impact that demonstrates the true potential of cryptocurrency - not just as speculative assets, but as tools for meaningful change in people's lives.

## The Numbers Tell the Story

Across the 4 rounds that included our integration:
- **48.08%** of funds flowed through the fiat integration
- **530** additional non-crypto users were able to donate

These numbers represent something bigger than just transaction volume - they represent accessibility. By building bridges between traditional payment methods and on-chain donations, we opened up participation to hundreds of people who otherwise wouldn't have been able to contribute.

## Building the Future with Normie Tech

This success helped convince the viaPrize team to build **Normie Tech** as a solution that allows someone to pay in fiat with their card to a platform or business that receives that payment as stablecoins.

The vision is simple but powerful: remove the friction between traditional finance and crypto-enabled impact while maintaining the transparency and efficiency benefits of blockchain technology.

## Community Impact and Recognition

The Gitcoin forum retrospective of the Youth In Need round can be seen here - [https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg22-youth-in-need-retrospective/19652](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg22-youth-in-need-retrospective/19652)

This retrospective showcases not just the technical success of the integration, but the human stories behind the numbers - families with roofs over their heads, communities rebuilt, and hope restored.

## The Magic is Real

Let's build a world where magic internet money makes life transforming impact!

What started as an experiment in payment integration has become proof that the crypto ecosystem can solve real problems for real people. When we talk about "magic internet money," we're not just talking about digital assets - we're talking about the magic of connecting global resources with local needs, of turning code into concrete, and of transforming lives one transaction at a time.

The house in Vietnam stands as a testament to what's possible when we build technology with purpose and humanity at its core.
